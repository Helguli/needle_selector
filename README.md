# Needle selector for the LK150 knitting machine

A few additional needle selectors for the LK150 knitting machine.

This contains two OpenSCAD files, one for the constants, one for the object.  
The _generate\_stls.py_ generates the files for the patterns contained in that file.

If you spot an error or want a needle selector with different parameters, feel free to open an issue.
